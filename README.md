### Hi there! I am [Waldyr Faustini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/waldyrfmfaustini/)

I have worked in a trading desk my entire career, I started in São Paulo and moved to New York in 2019. I have worked in Credit, Rates, FX and FX Options during the last couple of years. Since I started in finance, I have seen some huge transformations in the market throughout the years and I am confident that algorithmic machines are changing the way we trade in the market.
