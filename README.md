### Hi there! I am [Waldyr Faustini](https://www.linkedin.com/in/waldyrfmfaustini/) 


 <p>

I am 30 years old and I majored  in Physics at [Universidade de São Paulo - USP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_São_Paulo), [Instituto de Física da USP (IFUSP)](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instituto_de_F%C3%ADsica_da_Universidade_de_São_Paulo) . 
 
I have worked in a trading desk my entire career, I started in São Paulo in 2014 and moved to New York in 2019. I have worked in Credit, Rates, FX and FX Options during the last couple of years. Since I started my career in finance,  I have seen some huge transformations in the market throughout the years and I am confident that algorithmic machines are changing the way we trade in the market. To become better equipped to these new changes and to become a top notch professional I began looking into courses and schools that would help me obtain a solid background in the algo field.  I started my master’s degree program in [Financial Engineering with concentration in Algorithmic Trading Strategies](https://www.stevens.edu/school-business/masters-programs/financial-engineering/curriculum-overview) at [Stevens Institute of Technology](https://www.stevens.edu) last summer (2020) to learn advanced technical skills. I just completed halfway through the path to get my degree and I can say I have been learning a lot since I started the program. I took classes in derivatives, mathematical fundamentals, coding, and financial modeling.
 
 My coursework at Stevens:
 - [Pricing and Hedging (FE620)](https://fsc.stevens.edu/fe620-pricing-and-hedging/)
 - [Stochastic Calculus for Financial Engineers (FE610)](https://fsc.stevens.edu/fe610-stochastic-calculus-for-financial-engineers/)
 - [Market Microstructure and Trading Strategies (FE570)](https://fsc.stevens.edu/fe570-market-microstructure-and-trading-strategies/)
 - [Computational Methods in Finance (FE621)](https://fsc.stevens.edu/fe621-computational-methods-in-finance/)
 - [Portfolio Theory and Applications (FE630)](https://fsc.stevens.edu/fe630-portfolio-theory-and-applications/)
 - [Advanced Derivatives (FE680)](https://fsc.stevens.edu/fe680-advanced-derivatives/)
 
 I am deeply interested in Algorithmic and Systematic Trading. In the next 18 months I will attend [NYU (New York University) - Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences](https://cims.nyu.edu/dynamic/) as Non-Degree Graduate Student for [Mathematics in Finance](https://math.nyu.edu/financial_mathematics/academics/courses/) program, I will take 5 courses at  Graduate level to learn more about Machine Learning applied to Finance, Statistical Arbitrage and Algorithmic Trading.
 
 My coursework plan is:
 - [Data Science And Data-Driven Modeling (MATH-GA.2070)](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/courses/graduate-course-descriptions/as/fall-2021/#math-ga2070-001)
 - [Machine Learning & Computational Statistics (MATH-GA.2071)](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/courses/graduate-course-descriptions/as/spring-2021/#math-ga2071-001)
 - [Algorithmic Trading & Quantitative Strategies (MATH-GA.2708)](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/courses/graduate-course-descriptions/as/spring-2021/#math-ga2708-001)
 - [Time Series Analysis & Statistical Arbitrage(MATH-GA.2707)](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/courses/graduate-course-descriptions/as/fall-2021/#math-ga2707-001)
 - [Trends In Financial Data Science(MATH-GA.2047)](https://math.nyu.edu/dynamic/courses/graduate-course-descriptions/as/fall-2021/#math-ga2047-001)
